about = %q{

The political discussions that inform and define our lives have become mired in
passivity, shaped by the protection of our first world privileges, and
generally ignore the anger and discontent that lie deep within us. This _____
has lead to half-measures and tempered voices that avoid confrontation for the
sake of polite discourse and retaining the illusory calm that maintains order
and business as usual.

**All Attack, No Hold Back** is not a voice of calm. It is not a plea for peace
and measured reservation. It is genuine hostility and a deliberate increase in
volume of radical voices, offering permission to those of us ready to
let loose through both word and deed. More than just anger for anger’s sake,
however, **All Attack, No Hold Back** is perspective born through countless
years of skepticism, informed research and discussion from our various
positions on the social pyramid of hierarchy and privilege, and experimentation 
with alternative strategies in opposition to the dictactes of dominant culture.

To be succinct, **All Attack, No Hold Back** is pissed off and we aren’t going
to be quiet about it. We see clearly that dominant culture is driving us
towards increasingly catastrophic moments where those on the bottom suffer the
most. We see clearly that everything is going to shit, and although we
acknowledge our privileges, stand amongst A-List celebrities, and reap the
benefits of first-world creature comforts, it doesn’t change the fact that
everything is still going to shit. We’re calling it all out for what it truly
is, (hopefully) intelligently, but (always) unapologetically.

Don’t say we didn’t warn you.
